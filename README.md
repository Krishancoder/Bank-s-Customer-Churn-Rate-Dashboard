# 1.Title - BankPulse: Customer Churn Rate Analysis Dashboard

A dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze churn patterns across a bank's customer base using segmentation by account balance, age gropus, credit score, demographics, and activity — enabling strategic, data-driven retention planning.

# 2. Purpose of the Dashboard

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for data visualization and dashboard design.
📂 Power Query Editor – Used for transforming, cleaning, and shaping raw customer data.
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created calculated columns, dynamic measures, and custom KPIs like churn rate and customer categories.
🧱 Data Modeling – Connected multiple customer dimensions (age, account balance, credit score) to enable filter-based analysis.
📁 File Format – .pbix (Power BI project file) for development; .png for preview.

# 4. Data Source

Data on ~10,000 bank customers, including detailed attributes such as account balance, age group, gender, credit score, tenure, number of products held, credit card ownership, activity status, and country of residence. The dataset also includes a churn indicator flag for each customer and supports segmentation logic via account balance and credit score ranges for advanced behavioral analysis.
